The backslash retains its meaning only when followed by
        - dollar
        - backtick
        - double quote
        - backslash or newline

Within double quotes, the backslashes are removed from the input stream when followed by one of these characters.
Backslashes preceding characters that don't have a special meaning are left unmodified for processing by the shell interpreter.
